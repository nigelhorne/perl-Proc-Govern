         [BUG FIXES]

         - Install TERM handler (and INT) to kill child.

         - Add temporary workaround for 'unless ($h->pump_nb) { sleep 1 }' not
           working, by using 'sleep 0.1'.


0.03     2013-04-17 (SHARYANTO)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Rename --single to --single-instance.

         [BUG FIXES]

         - Single instance didn't work (bug in Proc::PID::File? one must use
           running() instead of new()+alive()).

         - --name and --pid-dir was not passed.

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add --on-multiple-instance which can be set to 'exit' to silently
           exit when there is another instance running (instead of displaying an
           error message).
